As for middle-aged people, it is a much strong desire rooted in their nature to possess a good life, correspondingly, good jobs enable 
them to enjoy their life more easily. In other words, bad jobs can not meet the needs of people who desire to own a relaxing life, which 
can partly accounting for the phenomenon shown in the chart. For another things, the middle-age's living pressure has been expanding gradually 
in recent years, thus exerting an impact on people's satisfaction with jobs.
   Taking the aspects of the people and the whole society, we may make a reasonable prediction. It can be inferred that the proportion of 
people's dissatisfaction with jobs is projected to show a downward trend owing to the improvement of social welfare.
